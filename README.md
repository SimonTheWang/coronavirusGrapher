# coronavirusGrapher
The task of this project is to predict the end of new cases of COVID-19 mathematically using data provided from a coronavirus API and using machine learning. The program, written in python, allows for users to input their respective countries, if available within the database and then enter their desired city or province if necessary, to view a graphical representation of the evolution of covid-19 cases in the chosen area. The prediction is handled using polynomial regression, and displays a polynomial of degree 2 to generalize a tendency for the total cases and cases per day of the virus in the given area, which allows for users to predict the number of cases in the future.

Key-words: Polynomial regression, COVID-19, Python, Machine Learning, Graph
